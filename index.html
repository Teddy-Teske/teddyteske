    <h2>About The Author</h2>
    <p>
        Teddy Teske is a sound designer, systems administrator, and emerging author whose work explores the intersection of technology, consciousness, and the nature of reality. With over a decade of experience in both the film and IT industries, he has long been drawn to big questions about existence, creation, and the structure of the universe. His curiosity began at age 17 after seeing a famous deep-space image captured by NASA’s Hubble Telescope often referred to as a “look back in time,” which sparked a lifelong fascination with cosmology, simulation theory, and the origins of life.

Throughout his career, Teddy continued researching these ideas in his free time, constantly reading, reflecting, and exploring philosophical and scientific perspectives on whether reality itself could be artificial. A pivotal moment came when he heard a well-known thought experiment: if a future superintelligent AI could answer only one question, what would it be? The response — “What’s outside the simulation?” — deeply resonated with him. In 2023, this curiosity led him to write an article titled Are We Living in The Matrix?, which was later published by an independent online blog. Building on that momentum, he spent the following years developing his first book, Beyond The Glitch, written alongside his work in IT and audio production. This debut marks the beginning of his journey as an author, with more thought-provoking work to come.
